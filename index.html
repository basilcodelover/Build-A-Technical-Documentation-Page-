       <p class="a">1. NumPy</p>
     </header>
    <p>When it comes to scientific computing, NumPy is one of the fundamental packages for Python providing support for large multidimensional arrays and matrices along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to execute these functions swiftly. NumPy relies on BLAS and LAPACK for efficient linear algebra computations. NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.</p>

      <p class="b">2. PyTorch</p> 
    </header>
    <p>Introduced by Facebook in 2017, PyTorch is a Python package which gives the user a blend of 2 high-level features – Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration and developing Deep Neural Networks on a tape-based auto diff system. PyTorch provides a great platform to execute Deep Learning models with increased flexibility and speed built to be integrated deeply with Python.</p>

    <p class="c">3. PyBrain</p>
  </header>
  <p>PyBrain contains algorithms for neural networks that can be used by entry-level students yet can be used for state-of-the-art research. The goal is to offer simple, flexible yet sophisticated and powerful algorithms for machine learning with many pre-determined environments to test and compare your algorithms. Researchers, students, developers, lecturers, you and me – we can all use PyBrain.</p>

<section class="main-section" id="4._Pandas">
  <header>
      <p class="d">4. Pandas</p>
  </header>
  <p>It is an open-source, BSD licensed library. Pandas enable the provision of easy data structure and quicker data analysis for Python. For operations like data analysis and modelling, Pandas makes it possible to carry these out without needing to switch to more domain-specific language like R. The best way to install Pandas is by Conda installation.

  <p>Open Source Computer Vision or OpenCV is used for image processing. It is a Python package that monitors overall functions focused on instant computer vision. OpenCV provides several inbuilt functions, with the help of this you can learn Computer Vision. It allows both read and write images at the same time. Objects such as faces, trees, etc., can be diagnosed in any video or image. It is compatible with Windows, OS-X, and other operating systems. </p>
  
  <p>You can install these libraries by entering the code given below in the terminal of your text editor or IDE</p>
   <li><code>pip install numpy</code> - NumPy</li>
    <li><code>pip install pytorch</code> - PyTorch </li>
     <li><code>pip install pybrain3</code> - PyBrain </li>
      <li><code>pip install cv</code> - Open CV</li>
       <li><code>pip install pandas</code> - Pandas</li>
